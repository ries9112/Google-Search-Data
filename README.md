# Google-Search-Data


### Three main goals:

1. "Live" (up to 1-2 hours) dashboard that draws relationships between the Google searches for "covid testing", "covid symptoms", etc.., and the number of cases, deaths and tests by State.

2. Dashboard that tracks Google Trends data for information around when and how to vote. Ideally could look at past elections to make models making "live" predictions on the voter turnout in a particular area

3. Scripts for business usecases to calculate CTR over time
